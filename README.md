#zh-sl4a-search

##Introduction

**Note** this prototype was mainly developed on a Nexus 7 during bus journeys and there have been a couple of minor issues with git on the Nexus for example I cannot get commits to pick up my user.name.

A prototype to test the usefulness of a search tool to help learners of Mandarin Chinese. The purpose of the tool is to provide a dialog driven, fully functional search tool to allow searches against a Chinese to English dictionary.

The tool provides an optional type of fuzzy search which allows a user to choose from alternative pinyin of sounds they may have misheard, or that may have been pronounced in a non-standard way.

The final application will include funtionality to help users that are not fully familiar with pinyin.
 
The next prototype will be re-implemented as a seperate project.
