#zh-sl4a-search

##Introduction

**Note** this prototype was mainly developed on a Nexus 7 during bus journeys and there have been a couple of minor issues with git on the Nexus for example I cannot get commits to pick up my user.name. As this is a basic prototype of some of functionality and the limitations of working with git on a Nexus; the git repository is fairly simple.

A prototype to test the usefulness of a search tool to help learners of Mandarin Chinese. The purpose of the tool is to provide a dialog driven, fully functional search tool to allow searches against a Chinese to English dictionary. Search results are returned ordered by frequency of usage ordered from high usage to low usage.

The dictionary database is derived from the [cc-cedict dictionary](http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cedict), the frequency data is derived from Leeds university frequency lists (the one derived from the Internet Corpus) see [this page](http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/list.html) for more details.

The tool provides an optional type of fuzzy search which allows a user to choose from alternative pinyin of sounds they may have misheard, or that may have been pronounced in a non-standard way.

The final application will include more funtionality including further functionality to help users that are not fully familiar with pinyin.
 
The next prototype will be re-implemented as a seperate project and made available via a web-browser.

##Installing and running
