#zh-sl4a-search

A prototype to test the usefulness of a search tool to help learners of Mandarin Chinese. The purpose of the tool is to provide a dialog driven, fully functional search tool to allow searches against a Chinese to English dictionary.

The tool provides an optional type of fuzzy search which allows a user to choose from alternative pinyin of sounds they may have misheard, or that may have been mispronounced.
